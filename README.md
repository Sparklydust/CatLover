# CatLover

## Dependency Injection with Factory

This project uses the [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory) package to handle dependency injection, keeping the code modular and testable.

### Why Factory?

- **Modularity**: Components are loosely connected, making them easier to work with and extend.
- **Testability**: Dependencies can be easily mocked for testing.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces setup complexity with a straightforward approach.

### Benefits for CatLover

Factory helps keep the CatLover app clean and flexible, supporting easy testing and modular design for future features.
